# NetSquid

The [Network Simulator for Quantum Information Using Discrete Events (NetSquid)](https://netsquid.org/) is a software tool, shared as a python package, developed at QuTech for modeling and simulation of scalable quantum networks. NetSquid's mission is to empower scientists and engineers to develop the future quantum internet and modular quantum computing architectures.

NetSquid's ability to simply and precisely model the impact of time on the performance of quantum networks and quantum computing systems is one of its primary advantages. This is a necessary component in the development of scalable systems, which necessitate a design that can minimize the short lifetime of quantum bits processed by quantum devices.

NetSquid's modular methodology enables accurate physical modeling of individual components that, like Lego blocks, can be easily joined to construct complex simulations of large scale systems.

The purpose of the repository is to engage the public with the possibilities of a program like NetSquid. I have included a variety of tutorials to help people get started with NetSquid and realize it's potential. The tutorials will start from the fundamentals and build up to building and designing your own quantum network.
